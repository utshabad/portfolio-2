            <p>
                Hi there! I’m <b>Utshab Adhikari</b>, currently an 11th-grade student with a keen interest in Computer Science. Ever since I started exploring the world of coding, I’ve been fascinated by how technology can solve real-world problems. I’m passionate about learning new programming languages, building projects, and understanding the concepts behind software development.

                In addition to my studies, I enjoy working on personal tech projects, whether it's creating small apps, websites, or exploring machine learning. My goal is to continue expanding my knowledge in this field, with hopes of pursuing a career in software engineering or data science in the future.
                
                I love being challenged and am always looking for opportunities to grow both academically and personally. When I’m not coding, I enjoy drawing and reading books and always look forward to collaborating on interesting projects with like-minded individuals.</p>
